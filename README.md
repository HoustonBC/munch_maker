Munch Maker is an app that allows users to find a random place to eat. Users enter their location which makes a Yelp API call. From the API call, users are then returned a single restaurant, which they can then "like" or "dislike". If the user likes one, it is persisted to the database. It is also added to a React-based sidebar menu, which displays all the restaurants that the specific user "liked". From here the user can then either delete a match, or they can create a "plan". Creating a plan, lets a user invite other user to attend the restaurant with them.

I built my app, "Munch Maker", because I though it was both, a fun way to solve an issue that plagues us all, "I'm hungry but I don't know where I want to eat." It was also a cool way to create an amalgam of all the various skills and technologies I've learned here at Launch.
